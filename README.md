# Transcription Page
#### (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

I am currently working on the Transcription Page for Free Genealogy UK. The purpose of the page is to upload genealogical documents to be displayed and enable transcribers record the data so that information is accessible online. I have almost completed the image carousel to switch between images and the photo editor where the transcriber can adjust the brightness, zoom in and out and rotate the image to make their transcription work easier for historical documents that can be difficult to read.

## Amendments for the future

This is still a work in progress, especially regarding the table headers so the transcribers can input the data into the relevant fields. The table needs to be customisable with pre-defined and optional headers. Layouts / configuration of headers can be saved and re-activated at a later date by the transcriber who will be able to select multiple headers from a list in order to display accordingly. Existing layouts will need to be modifiable by the user. If no layouts have been created, the default table headers will be used.
